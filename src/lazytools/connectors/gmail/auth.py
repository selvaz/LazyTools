"""Parse the ``Authentication-Results`` email header.

DKIM / SPF / DMARC are the only signals that let us distinguish a genuinely
owner-sent email from a spoof. The parser is deliberately conservative: a
method counts as verified **only** when an *authoritative* result token for
it is exactly ``pass``. Anything else — ``fail``, ``none``, ``neutral``,
``softfail``, a missing header, or an unparseable one — is ``False``.

Three hardening rules guard against forged "pass" tokens:

1. **Authserv-id pinning.** When ``trusted_authserv_id`` is set, only
   headers whose leading authserv-id (the hostname before the first ``;``)
   *exactly* equals that value are parsed. Gmail prepends its own
   ``Authentication-Results: mx.google.com; …`` header and, per RFC 8601
   §5.7, strips any inbound copy claiming its own authserv-id. A forged
   header carried inside the message body must therefore use a *different*
   authserv-id — and is rejected outright when pinning is active. The match
   is exact (not a prefix) so a look-alike id such as
   ``mx.google.com.evil.com`` — which *starts with* the trusted value — is
   rejected.
2. **Comments are stripped first.** RFC 8601 headers carry CFWS comments and
   reason strings, e.g. ``spf=fail (sender note: spf=pass)``. Without
   stripping, the ``spf=pass`` inside the comment would be read as a result.
3. **The method must be a standalone token.** Matching is anchored to the
   start of the value or a ``;`` / whitespace boundary, so an extension field
   like ``x-dkim=pass`` or ``reason-spf=pass`` cannot impersonate a real
   ``dkim`` / ``spf`` result.

Pure-Python: importable without the Gmail extra.
