"""Gmail outbound tools for the worker.

Exposes two tools via the lazybridge ``ToolProvider`` protocol:

* ``gmail_create_draft`` — always allowed. Drafting is harmless; a human
  still has to hit send in the Gmail UI.
* ``gmail_send`` — guarded. Sending is an ``EXTERNAL_SEND`` action, so it
  consumes a **single, explicit confirmation** and the recipient must pass
  the optional allow-list. A blocked send raises :class:`GmailSendBlocked`.

Confirmation is deliberately *not* a sticky boolean. A human approval (via the
review queue) authorizes **one** send — either any recipient (``confirm_once``)
or a specific one (``confirm_send(to=...)``). Each send consumes one matching
grant, so an approved single message can't silently authorize a flood.

A grant may additionally be **bound to a task** with ``task_id=`` (the
``task_id`` returned by ``approve_task`` / ``schedule``). A task-bound grant is
only consumable by *that* task's worker, so under
``max_concurrent_inbound > 1`` an approval for one task can never be spent by a
different task running at the same time. The binding works because the gated
send is an ``async`` tool: lazybridge runs it in the worker's own context,
where ``PulseAgent`` has published the active task id.
